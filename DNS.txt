DNS stands for Domain Name System,
 and it's basically the internet‚Äôs version of a phone book.

üìò What DNS Does:
When you type a website like www.google.com into your browser,
 DNS translates that name into an IP address like 142.250.190.36, 
which is what computers use to find each other on the network.

‚öôÔ∏è How DNS Works (Step by Step):
You type a URL in your browser (e.g., www.example.com).
Browser checks cache: If the IP address was recently looked up, it‚Äôs stored in your device‚Äôs memory or local DNS cache. If found, it uses that.
Query goes to a DNS resolver: If not cached, your request is sent to a DNS recursive resolver (usually operated by your ISP or a third party like Google or Cloudflare).
Resolver checks with Root DNS Server: If it doesn‚Äôt know the address, it asks a root server, which directs it to the correct Top-Level Domain (TLD) server (like .com, .org, .net).
TLD server points to the authoritative DNS server for example.com.
Authoritative DNS server gives the IP address for the domain.
Your browser connects to that IP and loads the website.
